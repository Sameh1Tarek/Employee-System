A small project in C++ to manage employees. I used Vector to store data in order to be more flexible because it is dynamic.

Options available in the program:
1) To add a new employee.

2) To show all employees in the company.

3) To delete employees by their age.

4) Updating the salary by the name of the employee.

5) To exit the program.

When you enter another number, it will print "When you enter another number, it will print"
